    "# Section 2 Python Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we will explore the fundamentals of running Python code. We will look at the basic units of Python code (\"Statements\") and how the Python Interpreter converts them into code the computer can understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python Interpreter\n",
    "\n",
    "We won't get too indepth on how Python code is executed, but this section will give you a sneak peak at what Computer Scientists think about when writing code.\n",
    "\n",
    "At a high level, a computer has something called a CPU (central processing unit) which is a piece of hardware which can follow very very basic instructions. [Here is an example](https://os.mbed.com/media/uploads/4180_1/cortexm0_instructions.htm) of a common set of instructions. You'll notice that there isn't a whole lot it can do. However, these fundamental instructions are all you need to build up complex logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is were the Python Interpreter comes into play. The Python Interpreter is able to convert the Python code we write into the basic instructions the CPU understands.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you continue your Computer Science journey, you'll learn all about how a CPU handles instructions and the different ways you can take programming languages and convert them into CPU intructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python Statements and Mathematical Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "The most basic unit of Python are statements. Python is what we call a \"high level language\" which just means it reads a bit like human language. For example, below is the code to find the sum of `5 + 5`"
