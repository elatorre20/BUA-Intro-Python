    "So far, we have covered how to use logical and mathematical operations to make statements, different types and data structures to store information, and control structures such as loops and if statements. These constitute the fundamental building blocks of a programming language, and using just these you can write a program to do almost anything. Statements, data types, and control structures will make up the bulk of almost any program you write. But what if we want to do something very complex, or need to write a very large program? In this notebook and the next, we will cover two tools for organizing and reusing code: libraries and functions.\n",
