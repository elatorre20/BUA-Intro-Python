    "At this point we know the basic foundations of Python. We can start to write more complex programs. There are times however, when we don't want to write something from scratch that someone else has done. Instead of just copy and pasting work we can use these sections of code that someone has written these re-usable pieces of code are called libraries. These libraries are typically made up of functions which are pieces of code wrapped up in a way that we can \"call them\" multiple times. An example of a function is the `len` function which we have used to find the length of a list. Can you think of any other functions we have looked at?\n",
